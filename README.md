# Infinite Scroll Gallery 

This is a simple website to handle Scrolling Images Infinitely while the user is keeping scrolling down through a mouse or by clicking on the keypad. Also, a search bar was added in order to allow the user to search for specific image tag/category on Unsplash DB. This project was created with React hooks, and using unsplash API for fetching the images and their corresponding data.

>Note that this API is handling a limited requests/hour so due to this limitation, some assumtions/conditions was added in order to not exceed the limit.
